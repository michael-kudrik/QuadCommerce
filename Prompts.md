# Prompts.md

## Prompt History

### Prompt #1 (Original)
For each of the pages we just created, I want you to generate a list of plans and ideas for what features each of the pages will have. Put all of this in a .md file called PagesPlan.md also do not forget to log the prompt and response in Prompts.md

### Prompt #1 (Technical Rephrase)
Generate a per-route product planning document that defines feature scope, UX enhancements, and roadmap ideas for each existing page (login, register, dashboard, profile, services, chats, sell). Save it as `PagesPlan.md` in the project root, and append this prompt plus the generated response summary to `Prompts.md`.
